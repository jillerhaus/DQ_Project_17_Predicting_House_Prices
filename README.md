# DataQuest Project 17: House Prices Using a Linear Regression Model

This is the 17th project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project a dataset containing previously sold houses and some of their attributes was used to make predictions on their sale price using a linear regression model.

The educational goal of the project was to properly select and engineer the best features and then to use scikit-learn to train and test a linear regression model.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file containing data on previous house sales.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
